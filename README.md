I am Mahad, a dedicated veterinarian with over two years of experience in diagnosing and treating a diverse range of animals. My work involves close collaboration with farmers to promote animal health and welfare. I am deeply committed to educating both animal owners and farmers on best care practices, driven by my passion for animal welfare.

With a solid foundation in practical veterinary medicine and hands-on internship experience, I have actively engaged in research projects aimed at improving animal health and have contributed to publications in this field. I earned my degree in Veterinary Medicine from Somali National University in Mogadishu, Somalia, graduating with first-class honors.

I am passionate about advancing veterinary medicine and strive to make a meaningful impact on animal health and the community. I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals and sharing my knowledge to enhance animal welfare practices.
